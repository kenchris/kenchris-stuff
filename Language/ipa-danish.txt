These seem to be the best approximations I can come up with. 

There is a tradition to use other IPA signs for the sounds, but these doesn't follow the sound examples from the IPA.  Compare with English, Norwegian, Icelandic at http://www.omniglot.com

They other signs used are:
ɑ instead of æ		ö instead of œ		
å instead of ɔ		đ instead of đ ̞		
æ instead of e

I do not know the reason of this. But the above system seems to be used by some Danish dictionaries. Unfortunately, as Danish students map the sounds wrong in other languages.

The "semi-official" IPA document as it variates from the Handbook of the International Phonetic Association is located hereː http://www.cphling.dk/~ng/pdf_filer/jipa2000.pdf

The alphabet:

a 	[æ, a] 
b 	[b] 
c 	[s, k]

h 	[h, :]
i 	[i, e] 
j 	[j]

l 	[l] 
m 	[m] 
n 	[n] 
o 	[ʌ, ɔ, o]
p 	[p, b] 
q 	[k] 
r 	[r, ʀ] the r should be another letter, like the r in sp. pero, and not the rr in perro 
s 	[s] 
t 	[t, đ ̞, d]
u 	[u] 
v 	[v] 
w 	[v, w] 
x 	[ks] 
y 	[y, ʏ]

æ 	[e, ɛ] 
ø 	[ø, œ, ɶ]

Diphtongs, etc...

Grammatical endings
