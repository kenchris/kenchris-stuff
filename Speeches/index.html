     GNOME is really moving along nicely, and we 
     have reached a state where it is almost ready for general consumption. 
     GNOME 2.0 brings lots of improvements regarding usability and
     accessibility; and also brings major advantages for localization, 
     including Pango. 
   </p><p>
     Pango doesn't solve everything for us all by itself. First of all 
     we rely heavily on gettext and
     intltool. We also rely on a very strict 
     release schedule for handling translations. So far it has been  
     possible to translate GNOME into a variety of languages, but we have 
     not yet done to make GNOME act professionally in these languages.
   </p><p>
     There are major problems with our current way of releasing and having 
     a good localized GNOME desktop. People download new updates with such 
     tools as Red Carpet, and suddenly their 
     favorite program is no longer 100% translated but only 80%percnt;,
     and what does this &#8220;sort descending&#8221; mean? 
   </p><p>
     Big problems like these are what keep GNOME from being really usable 
     in non-English languages.
   </p><p>
     In this speech I shall talk about our current tools and release methods. 
     I will introduce developers to some of the hidden but very useful 
     features that intltool has.
   </p><p>
     As the end of the speech, I shall suggest a detailed idea of how to 
     improve some of these problems. After that, we can discuss 
     alternative ideas and figure out the future of GNOME and localization.

    A couple of years ago we were having a lot of problems with translation, 
    since a lot of new file formats like <tt>.glade</tt> and
    <tt>.server.in</tt> showed up. Together with Maciej and 
    Darin, I wrote intltool and we solved most 
    of these problems. 
  </p><p>
    During this work we noticed that it was a huge help to centralize all 
    kinds of translations into the <tt>.po</tt> files. This 
    made it possible to write status scripts that showed us exactly
    how well our language was supported, and also gave people a hint on
    when they had to start working again :)
  </p><p>
    There were still problems left. The most notable one was that people 
    didn't mail the <tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:gnome-i18n@gnome.org">gnome-i18n@gnome.org</a>&gt;</tt> mailing list to 
    announce that they were about to make new releases. This has improved 
    a lot, but it is still not perfect.
  </p><p>
    We also noticed that people often left out files from the 
    <tt>POTFILES.in</tt> file, so I wrote a
    <tt>--maintain</tt> option to check for this.
  </p><p>
    Over the last year intltool has envolved 
    and added features like this to help maintaining translations work. 
    Unfortunately only very few people know how to take advantage of these 
    features, and only a few people want to use intltool, so I have been 
    thinking about looking into the possibility of integrading intltool 
    with gettext. Whether this is a good idea 
    or not, I am not certain.
