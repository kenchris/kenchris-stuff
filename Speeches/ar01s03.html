   Here are my suggestions for guidelines.
 </p><div class="sect2"><a name="guide-general"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="guide-general"></a>General</h3></div></div><p>
     Try to release more overal GNOME releases, and fewer individual 
     package releases. 
   </p><p>
     It is a lot easier for translators to translate, review, and so on when
     they have adequate time. For a minor GNOME release, like for instance
     GNOME 2.0.1, it would be appropriate to have half a month from the string
     freeze until release.
   </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="guide-indiv"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="guide-indiv"></a>For individual packages</h3></div></div><p>
     When you want to release, please step into the 
     <tt>/po</tt> directory and
     run <b>intltool-update --maintain</b>. This will tell 
     you whether you have all the translatable files included in 
     <tt>POTFILES.in</tt>. If you don't, then please do add them. 
     Also make sure that the files are actually distributed along with the 
     package.
   </p><p>
     Use <b>more POTFILES.ignore</b> (if the file exists) to 
     see whether some files are ignored by mistake.
   </p><p>
     Now do <b>intltool-update --report</b>. This will list 
     the status of the different languages. If there is a language that 
     is well-supported, lets say <tt>sv</tt> is at 100%, 
     then run 
     <b>LC_ALL=sv <i><tt>your_program</tt></i></b>. 
     This should start your program with sv (Swedish) language support.
   </p><p>
     Now check very carefully whether the program is actually fully 
     translated. If is it not, there might be some problems to fix 
     before the release.
   </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a name="id2734944"></a>Small rant</h3><p>
      Now you may say &#8216;Well, this is the job of translators&#8217;.
      I do not agree with this. There are very few translators for each 
      language, and they have a tough enough time keeping up with releases, 
      reviewing translations, finding bugs and so on. They need all the help
      they can get.
    </p></div><p>
     If you see some English words, for example the word &#8220;Port&#8221;
     in the Swedish edition, and you are uncertain whether the words
     are Swedish or not, then you can search for &#8220;Port&#8221; in 
     the <tt>sv.po</tt> file. If &#8220;Port&#8221; is
     translated into the same word in Swedish it should look like this:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
msgid &quot;Port&quot;    // the English string
msgstr &quot;Port&quot;   // the Swedish string
   </pre><p>
     When everything is perfect it is then time to mail 
     <tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:gnome-i18n@gnome.org">gnome-i18n@gnome.org</a>&gt;</tt>.
   </p><p>
     Do this at least a week before the actual release. Try to include 
     the output of <b>intltool-update --report</b> in the email, 
     so translators don't have to go and check themselves unnecessarily.
   </p><p>
     Please send a second mail two days before release.
   </p><p>
     Let's say that you saved the output of 
     <b>intltool-update --report</b> the last time you 
     released. Maybe to <tt>/po/LAST_RELEASE</tt>. Now
     you are ready to release, you should check that no language that
     at last release was above 80% is less translated than before.
     If it is, you should mail the translation team and ask what is up, 
     and consider postponing the release for a couple of days or so. 
     This should minimize the chances of people suddently seeing their 
     desktop turn partly English.
   </p><p>
     Now enter <tt>po/</tt> and do 
     <b>intltool-update --report &gt; ./LAST_RELEASE</b>.
   </p><p>
     From the internationalization point of view, you are now ready 
     to release.
