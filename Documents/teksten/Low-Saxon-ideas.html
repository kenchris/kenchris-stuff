<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">What to do in order to keep Low
Saxon alive</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">By Kenneth
Rohde Christiansen</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Low Saxon
is dying out and quickly – we have to admit that, and look at our
alternatives. There has been some effort at standardizing the
dialects of Low Saxon in The Netherlands, and creating a writing
system (a different one per region, though). Because of this, we have
a lot of Low Saxon material today; poetry, novels, history books,
children’s literature etc. This is great and might help Low Saxon
to stay alive.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The
problem, though, is that young people don’t learn the dialects and
they don’t carry on the dialect to future generations. This is due
to many factors, and we have to look at what we can do in order to
change that.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This
document represents some of my theories (which might very well be
wrong) and ideas.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Judging
from myself, growing up speaking Jutish (a language/dialect spoken in
Denmark), being teased and corrected, I should have pretty good ideas
at what young people need. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Recognition
is the keyword, and the question is how to get this. A standard
writing system helps a lot, as has also been shown in other regions.
This is already present in the Netherlands for various Low Saxon
dialects, but as long as there isn’t a more broad standard writing
language, some young people will just see this as an attempt to write
in local dialect. Other young people need to accept Low Saxon as a
language before it gets their recognition. A standardized writing
system is crucial for language recognition.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I think it
is very important to develop one or two (maximum) standard writing
systems for Low Saxon in the Netherlands (Maybe ‘Algemeen
Noord-Oost Nedersaksisch’ and ‘Algemeen Zuid-Oost
Nedersaksisch’). However, this is very hard to do, and won’t be
something you can do from one day to another. And there is another
problem: many of those who have started to write Low Saxon want to
write as close to their home dialect as possible, this is pretty
understandable.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">What can
we do then? Well, we could look at the unique language situation in
Norway. In Norway, generally, it is very accepted to speak dialect.
Actually, people dislike when people try to put their dialect behind
them. Part of the reason for this, can be found in the writing
system. The writing system consists of main forms, and alternative
forms.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Ex. [alternative forms]</H1>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">the bed:
sengen, [senga]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is
very handy because of the following reasons. First of all, the main
forms together form a language of themselves, a common Norwegian,
which makes it possible for everyone to write books that addresses
everyone in Norway (that could for instance be a math book, or a book
on Norwegian history). However, it is also possible to write a novel
or poetry in your own dialect (or something that resembles it very
closely) by using the alternative forms.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The only
downside of this, as I have heard from Norwegians, is that allowing
too many alternative forms can be bad. It makes it hard correcting
essays etc, for instance. Thus, in Norway the minor alternative forms
are not added to their official dictionary.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Right now,
the dictionary of Grunnegers (Gronings) follows the Norwegian
example, and consists of alternative spellings as well, but there are
no forms that are marked as main forms. This means that if I wanted
to translate a book to Grunnegers, then I’d first have to decide
which dialect I am going to write; maybe, however, I’d want to
address all people speaking a Grunneger dialect. If some forms would
be marked as main forms (and forming some kind of ‘Aalgemeain
Grunnegers’), then I could translate using these forms and address
everyone. Maybe not in their home dialect, but in something which
might resemble it pretty well.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I see this
as the first step toward more recognition. This for instance means
that more general material can be produced. This might mean, though,
that Grunnegers will develop more in the way of the defined “common”
(Algemeen) language; but rather that than dying out…</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is
just a first step, but a very welcome step for Grunnegers, Dr&egrave;ents,
Twents etc. The next step is to see if it is possible to make these
Low Saxon languages a bit more ‘general’ in writing. I know that
Grunnegers and Dr&egrave;ents are quite different, so it might not be
possible to unite these dialects into one general writing language,
but it might be possible with others.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If we
could end up with two common languages of Low Saxon in The
Netherlands that would be great, and it might very well mean a better
chance at survival of Low Saxon. If these two languages then could be
standardized where possible, e.g. use the same vocal combinations for
the same sounds, use either ‘t or t in both languages etc., then
that might mean that the language will, in time, develop to be more
alike instead of just disappearing.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If a
certain kind of writing standardization has been established, it is
time to look at the practical side. In my eyes, an important matter
is spell check dictionaries for the computer. Young people use
computers, so let’s help them out, and let’s try to make it
available for free.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN LANG="en-US">What
is needed for a spell check dictionary is basically a simple list of
words. There are dictionaries for Grunnegers and Dr&egrave;ents, so
with these lists of Grunneger and Dr&egrave;ents words it would be
possible to create such spell check dictionaries. This is a limited
part of the original dictionaries (since the mapping to Dutch words
isn’t needed), so it would be nice if this could be free for
everyone; or at least released on a license like the GPL (</SPAN><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">www.gnu.org</A></U></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US">
for information). If it is licensed under the GPL it means that the
list of words is free for everyone (open source), but it is forbidden
to use info from the words list in anything you earn money from. This
means that it would be impossible to publish the word list in a book,
unless I sell the book for purely the production price.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN LANG="en-US">This
is a common license used in Open Source software; and if word lists
are released under this license, it will be possible for me to create
spell check dictionaries for Linux and the free office suite
OpenOffice ( and I am very willing to do this. It is probably also
possible to create a spell check dictionary for Word, but I have no
idea how to do this, and it might require using expensive software.
Still it would be very nice if we could ship free redistributable
spell check dictionaries for Word, OpenOffice and Linux; and it might
make a few more young people interested in writing in Grunnegers or
one of the other Low Saxon dialects.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN LANG="en-US">The
Internet has become very popular by young people and language
enthusiasts. Advantage should be taken. Dr&egrave;etse taol already
has a nice web page (www.drentsetaol.nl), and it might be possible to
create something in the same spirit for Low Saxon in Netherlands, and
make it a meeting point for Low Saxon speakers, including younger
ones. Maybe the web page of the federation SONT (</SPAN><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.sont.nl/"><SPAN LANG="en-US">www.sont.nl</SPAN></A></U></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US">)
could fill this need. Another possibility would be to use the
extensive network of language enthusiast (including Low Saxon) of
Lowlands-L (www.lowlands-l.net).</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Here it
would be possible to announce events, distribute spell checkers, give
small spellings tutorials and tell what is going on in the world of
Low Saxon; and maybe even have a meeting board where people can post
messages. If it could be done in cooperation with the German Low
Saxon speakers it would be even better and maybe help us cooperate
further.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mathieu
Van Woerkom has already created a nice page for the different
languages/dialect in the Netherlands (www.streektaal.cjb.net), so he
might be interested in helping running such a site. Such a site would
be a good way of uniting Low Saxon speakers (especially younger ones,
but I hope older ones will join as well) in the Netherlands, Germany,
or all over the world.
